# pyxlsxfunctions

Use functions from Excel in Python.

This package holds a suite of function names that you would commonly use in Microsoft Excel. Oftentimes, it can be difficult to transition to a different technology because one has to learn the names of new functions and their parameters. I attempt to make this transition easier by providing commonly used functions in this package that are from Microsoft Excel and able to be implemented in Python.
